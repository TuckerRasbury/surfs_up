## Overview of the Analysis
This quick analysis was intended to gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, and, ultimately, to ameliorate concerns from a prospective investor. To conduct this analysis, I made use of the following tools: Python/jupyter notebook and SQLAlchemy.

## Results
Here are three major takeaways from this analysis: 
* there is very little variance in temperature (approximately 3 degrees)in Oahu from the average 71 to 74 degrees it experiences, June and December respectively.
* Oahu does experience low temperatures (approximately 65), though rare, that could create a temporary dip in business.
* given the high number of observations for each month, we can act on this exploratory data analysis with confidence.
